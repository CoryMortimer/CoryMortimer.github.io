  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Cory and I am a dreamer and a doer. More concretely, I am a software engineer that likes to think of creative and new ideas. A few words that describe me are fun-loving, focused, and quirky.</p>
  <h2>Fun-loving</h2>
  <p>I greatly enjoy making life fun. I believe that working together on a team filled with positivity and laughter makes for a comfortable and productive environment. In my experience, a team is motivated and eager to work on tasks when a bit of laughter is introduced. Plus, smiling is nice!</p>
  <h2>Focused</h2>
  <p>When a task needs to be done, my attention is completely on it. I can quickly get into "the zone" even without the aid of coffee.</p>
  <h2>Quirky</h2>
  <p>Whether it is inventing a new pantomime for pushing to a git branch (reach for the sky and as you flick your wrist inwards, pull your arm back down and lower your fingers one by one until you make a fist) or forcing the office to play charades (we are getting better!), you will always tilt your head to the side and shrung at me.</p>
  <p>I designed this website myself with the help of the internet for inspiration and for some CSS guidance. This website uses the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> static site generator to make developing easier.</p>
